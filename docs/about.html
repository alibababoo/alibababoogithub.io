<p><strong>Taylor Swift</strong> is a prominent 21st century American singer-songwriterwho needs no further introduction. A household name in the singing industry, she is widely recognised for her songwriting, musicial versatility (especially pop and country genres), artistic reinventions and influence on the music industry.</p>
<p>Currently on an international tour called ‘<strong>Eras Tour</strong>’, Taylor Swift is on track to earn a whopping $4.1 billion from touring, making it the highest-grossing solo tour in history (The Economic Times, 2023). Additionally, she released The Eras Tour movie, setting multiple records, including the highest first-day ticket sales in 2023, the first concert movie to surpass $100 million, and the first concert movie to remain No.1 on the U.S. box office for two weeks (Thapa, 2023).</p>
<p>This amount of revenue from an artist’s concert is unprecedented and hence would be exciting to look into, to discover the unique selling points of Taylor Swift that sets her aside from other singers today.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="top-10-most-in-demand-concert-tickets-in-2023"><u>Top 10 most in-demand concert tickets in 2023</u></h2>
<p>As seen from the graph below, Taylor Swift’s concert tickets are on average the most expensive, more than double that of the second most expensive tickets which are for Morgan Wallen’s concerts.</p>
<p><img src="images/taylor%20ticket%20price%20.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This extremely hefty average concert ticket price tag does not come from Taylor Swift selling her tickets at astronomical prices, but more so due to the high demand and lack of supply of concert tickets. Hence, there are many people who look into the resale market to buy her tickets, which are sold at staggering prices, due to demand-supply market forces.</p>
<p>There are many stories online about how her fans, swifties, have resorted to paying exorbitant prices for her concert tickets, as they were unable to purchase it from Ticketmaster. A fan reported paying a little over 5,500USD for two Taylor Swift’s concert tickets (Kaplan, 2023).</p>
<p>With data comparing the demand of Taylor Swift’s concert to other artists and testimonials from swifties who were willing to pay sky-high prices to see Taylor, these go to prove the immense power and popularity of Taylor Swift who has captivated the hearts of her fans.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-analysis-of-taylor-swifts-songs"><u>Data analysis of Taylor Swift’s songs</u></h2>
<p>This dataset cotains the data of the ‘name’, ‘album’, ‘date’, ‘acousticness’, ‘danceability’, ‘energy’, ‘liveness’, ‘speechiness’, ‘tempo’, ‘valence’, ‘popularity’, and ‘minutes’ of each Taylor Swift song.</p>
<p>I will be using these data later to look at the trends and differences among the songs for some of the listed categories and come up with my own interpretation supported by others/ experts’ opinions.</p>

<p><img src="images/table%20.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>As Taylor Swift has released way too many songs, <strong>approximately 237 songs</strong>, which includes all of her original songs, covers, holiday songs, soundtrack songs, and live recordings (Anderson, 2023), I have narrowed down to only focusing on her songs with a popularity rating of 80 and above.</p>
<p>From the scatter plot and the table above, the album that is most loved by swifties would be <strong>reputation</strong>, with 11 of the 63 songs with a popularity rating of 80 and above found in this album. The top song of reputation album would be ‘Dont Blame Me’ with a popularity rating of 90 as seen in the scatter plot.</p>
<p>My personal take on why reputation is so popular would be due to the fact that this was the first album Taylor released after lots of controversy about her after her 1989 album release in 2014. Prior to the release of this album, Taylor has disappeared from public view after Kim Kardashian released the details of a private phone call with Kanye West (CBS News, 2017), and there was even a hate train online where people used the hashtag #KimExposedTaylorParty to diss Taylor (Mackenzie, 2016). Hence, this album was seen as a comeback by Taylor where many of the songs revealed certain gossips or emotions felt by Taylor throughout the controversies and rumours about her. This was also an album which was lyrically and sonically extremely different from her previous pop and country albums, which talked more about love and heartbreaks, while this album was more about being confident, acknowledging her flaws and dismissing people’s unfair opinions about her.</p>
<p>It is also worthy to note that her most popular song to date is ‘Cruel Summer’ with a popularity rating of 98, where the next most popular song only has a rating of 92. In fact, it was so well-loved by swifties that Taylor decided to start off every Eras Tour concert with this song.<br>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-analysis-of-the-different-attributes-of-taylor-swift-songs"><u>An analysis of the different attributes of Taylor Swift songs</u></h2>
<iframe height="400" width="100%" frameborder="no" src="https://alibababoo.shinyapps.io/analysis/"> </iframe>
<p>I have analysed the varying attributes of Taylor’s songs, namely ‘acousticness’, ‘danceability’, ‘energy’, ‘liveness’, ‘tempo’ and ‘valence’. I wondered if the success of Taylor’s songs is due to the fact that she has been following a ‘top pop music template’ consistently to produce her music or that she is just phenomenal in her songwriting such that regardless of the genre of music she puts out, swifties end up loving her songs.</p>
<p>To analyse her music, I followed the metrics concluded by an article after analyzing data from the Billboard Hot 100 Chart of hit songs (Viner, 2020). The article pointed out that popular songs tend to have these characteristics: <strong>High danceability and energy, low acousticness and a tempo around 117 BPM</strong>.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the boxplots of Taylor’s top songs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Acousticness</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Minimum value: 0.00</p></li>
<li><p>First Quartile: 0.03</p></li>
<li><p>Median: 0.08</p></li>
<li><p>Third Quartile: 0.27</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum value: 0.92</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can observe that Taylor’s songs indeed mostly rank pretty low in terms of acousticness, with a median of 0.08. However, as seen by the pink dots on the graph, there do seem to be quite a few outliers, where her popular songs rank high in acousticness.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><strong>Danceability</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Minimum value: 0.29</p></li>
<li><p>First Quartile: 0.55</p></li>
<li><p>Median: 0.63</p></li>
<li><p>Third Quartile: 0.70</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum value: 0.82</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can observe that Taylor’s songs rank from average to high danceability, with a median of 0.63. However, as seen by the pink dots on the graph, she has songs on both extremes of the danceability scale, highlighting her versatility in releasing songs that are well loved regardless of its danceability.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Energy</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Minimum value: 0.22</p></li>
<li><p>First Quartile: 0.47</p></li>
<li><p>Median: 0.62</p></li>
<li><p>Third Quartile: 0.73</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum value: 0.89</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can observe that Taylor’s songs rank rather average in terms of energy, with a median of 0.62. The interquartile range (IQR) of her song’s energy is rather wide, indicating that there are many songs that make up a wide range of energy levels, indicating that her songs all contain different levels of energy but are still equally successful and that not only high in energy songs would be popular for Taylor.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Tempo</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Minimum value: 68.53</p></li>
<li><p>First Quartile: 100.12</p></li>
<li><p>Median: 120.58</p></li>
<li><p>Third Quartile: 149.98</p></li>
<li><p>Maximum value: 203.89</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can observe that Taylor’s songs indeed do fare similar to the average 117 BPM of popular songs, with a median of 120.58 BPM.</p>
<p>All in all, data concludes that Taylor’s popular songs do have attributes that are congruent to popular songs today. However, this is not the most accurate way of determining Taylor’s success as she is already extremely popular today, with many of her songs ialready n the Billboard Top 100 songs, it is like analysing Taylor’s songs and concluding that the data shows that popular songs have similar attribute to Taylor’s songs. Her songs were most likely sampled by the article before coming to those conclusions. This method would work much better for an upcoming artist that is trying to make their name known in the Billboard Top 100, where formulating their songs with these data statistics might give them higher chances of being successful.</p>
<p>Albeit, this analysis is not all useless as the presence of the well-spread outliers (pink dots) on each box plot are indicators that Taylor has been successful in producing songs that lie outside of the perimeters of what is considered to make a song popular. These outliers are indicators that Taylor transcends the need to create songs that follow rigid templates in order to be successful, she has been and is successful in producing songs that lie outside of the perimeters of what is considered to make a song popular. Many people have dubbed her as ‘The Music Industry’ due to her immense influence in the music industry today. Taylor’s success is definitely phenomenal and cannot be replicated by any other singer, from her ability to gain popularity despite changing music genres to her many controversies, Taylor has always remained on top of the music industry for her genuineness, relatable lyricism and her immaculate performance skills.<br>
